# EMBEDDED SYSTEM
## IOT BASED TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
### INTRODUCTION
The temperature and humidity of an environment is of uttermost importance to humans, getting to know the current temperature and humidity of the air in the environment. We would be measuring the temperature and humidity by building a system using a list of components stated below.
#### STATEMENT OF PROBLEM
Humans are faced with the challenge of getting to know the temperature and humidity of the air in the environment, to enable them know when to turn on or turn off an air conditioner, generally to give them control over the temperature of their environment. Although some systems have been created to automatically tell the temperature of the environment, we are leveraging the DHT11 sensor and nodemcu to build a system to help solve the problem stated. In this project we would be using the nodemcu to create a communication between the hardware system developed and the google firebase (a database to hold data sent from the microcontroller), an MIT app would be created to fetch the current data from the microcontroller and display it to the user.
#### COMPONENTS TO BE USED
##### 1. ESP8266 nodemcu board:

The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. It creates a communication between the hardware components and the database. It also houses the microcontroller that processes the software codes sent to the hardware components.
##### 2. DHT-11 Sensor:
